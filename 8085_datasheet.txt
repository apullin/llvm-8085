The Intel 8085AH is a complete 8-bit parallel Centra! Processing Unit (CPU) implemented in N-channel,
depletion load, silicon gate technology (HMOS). Its instruction set is 100% software compatible with the
8080A microprocessor, and it is designed to improve the present 8080A's performance by higher system
speed. Its high level of system integration allows a minimum system of three IC’s [8085AH (CPU), 8156H
(RAM/IO) and 8755A (EPROM/IO)] while maintaining total system expandability. The 8085AH-2 and
B8085AH-1 are faster versions of the 8085AH.

The 8085AH incorporates all of the features that the 8224 (clock generator) and 8228 (system controller)
provided for the 8080A, thereby offering a higher level of system integration.

The 8085AH uses a multiplexed data bus. The address is split between the 8-bit address bus and the 8-bit
data bus. The on-chip address latches of 8155H/8156H/8755A memory products allow a direct interface with
the 8085AH.

Ag-Ai5               ADDRESS BUS: The most significant 8 bits of memory address or the 8 bits of the
                     \/O address, 3-stated during Hold and Halt modes and during RESET.
                     MULTIPLEXED ADDRESS/DATA BUS: Lower 8bits of the memory address (or
                     |/O address) appear on the bus during the first clock cycle (T state) of a machine
                     cycle. It then becomes the data bus during the second and third clock cycles.
                     ADDRESS LATCH ENABLE: it occurs during the first clock state of a machine
                     cycle and enables the address to get latched into the on-chip latch of peripherals.
                     The falling edge of ALE is set to guarantee setup and hold times for the address
                     information. The falling edge of ALE can also be used to strobe the status
                     information. ALE is never 3-stated.

                       X = unspecified
                     $1 can be used as an advanced R/W status. |O/M, Sg and S; become valid at the
                     beginning of a machine cycle and remain stable throughout the cycle. The falling
                     edge of ALE may be used to latch the state of these lines.
                     READ CONTROL: Aiow level on RD indicates the selected memory or I/O device
                     is to be read and that the Data Bus is available for the data transfer, 3-stated during
                     Hold and Halt modes and during RESET.
                     WROTE CONTROL: A jow level on WR indicates the data on the Data Bus is to be
                     written into the selected memory or I/O location. Data is set up at the trailing edge
                     of WR. 3-stated during Hold and Halt modes and during RESET.
                     READY: If READY is high during a read or write cycle, it indicates that the memory
                     or peripheral is ready to send or receive data. If READY is low, the CPU will wait an
                     integral number of clock cycles for READY to go high before completing the read
                     or write cycle. READY must conform to specified setup and hold times.
                     HOLD: Indicates that another master is requesting the use of the address and data
                     buses. The CPU, upon receiving the hold request, will relinquish the use of the bus
                     as soon as the completion of the current bus transfer. Internal processing can
                     continue. The processor can regain the bus only afterthe HOLD is removed. When
                     the HOLD is acknowledged, the Address, Data RD, WR, and IO/M lines are
                     3-stated.
                     HOLD ACKNOWLEDGE: Indicates that the CPU has received the HOLD request
                     and that it will relinquish the bus in the next clock cycle. HILDA goes low after the
                     Hold request is removed. The CPU takes the bus one half clock cycle after HLDA
                     goes low.
                     INTERRUPT REQUEST: Is used as a general purpose interrupt. It is sampled only
                     during the next to the last clock cycle of an instruction and during Hold and Halt
                     states. If it is active, the Program Counter (PC) will be inhibited from incrementing
                     and an INTA will be issued. During this cycle a RESTART or CALL instruction can
                     be inserted to jump to the interrupt service routine. The INTR is enabled and
                     disabled by software. It is disabled by Reset and immediately after an interrupt is
                     accepted.

                               INTERRUPT ACKNOWLEDGE: Is used instead of (and has the same timing as)
                               RD during the Instruction cycle after an INTR is accepted. It can be used to
                               activate an 82594 Interrupt chip or some other interrupt port.
                               RESTART INTERRUPTS: These three inputs have the same timing as INTR
                               except they cause an internal RESTART to be automatically inserted.
                               The priority of these interrupt is ordered as shown in Table 2. These interrupts have
                               a higher priority than INTR. In addition, they may be individually masked out using
                               the SIM instruction.
                               TRAP: Trap interrupt is a non-maskable RESTAAT interrupt. It is recognized at the
                               same time as INTR or RST 5.5-7.5. It is unaffected by any mask or Interrupt
   ~                  |        Enable. It has the highest priority of any interrupt. (See Table 2.)
   RESET IN                    RESET IN: Sets the Program Counter to zero and resets the Interrupt Enable and
                               HLDA flip-flops. The data and address buses and the control lines are 3-stated
                               during RESET and because of the asynchronous nature of RESET, the processor's
                               internal registers and flags may be altered by RESET with unpredictable results.
                              RESET IN is a Schmitt-triggered input, allowing connection to an R-C network for
                       power-on RESET delay (see Figure 3). Upon power-up, RESET IN must remain low
                       for at least 10 ms after minimum Vcc has been reached. For proper reset
                       operation after the power-up duration, RESET IN should be kept low a minimum of
                      ;three clock periods. The CPU is held in the reset condition as long as RESET IN is
                               applied.
   RESET OUT           eo RESET OUT: Reset Out indicates CPU is being reset. Can be used as a system
                          reset. The signal is synchronized to the processor clock and lasts an integral
                          number of clock periods.
                               X41 and Xg: Are connected to a crystal, LC, or RC network to drive the internal
                               clock generator. X; can also be an external clock input from a logic gate. The input
                               frequency is divided by 2 to give the processor's internal operating frequency.
                               CLOCK: Clock output for use as a system clock. The period of CLK is twice the X41,
                               Xo input period.
                               SERIAL INPUT DATA LINE: The data on this line is loaded into accumulator bit 7
                               whenever a RIM instruction is executed.
                               SERIAL OUTPUT DATA LINE: The output SOD is set or reset as specified by the
                               SIM instruction.

NOTES:
1. Ag—-A1s address Specs apply |O/M, So, and S; except Ag~Aj5 are undefined during T4-Tg of OF cycle whereas |O/M,
Spo, and S; are stable.
2. Test Conditions: tcyc = 320 ns (B085AH)/200 ns (8085AH-2);/167 ns (BO85AH-1); C, = 150 pF.
3. For all output timing where C # 150 pF use the following correction factors:
   25 pF < CG, < 150 pF: —0.10 ns/pF
   150 pF < C_ < 300 pF: +0.30 ns/pF
4. Output timings are measured with purely capacitive load.
5. To calculate timing specifications at other values of toyc use Table 5.
